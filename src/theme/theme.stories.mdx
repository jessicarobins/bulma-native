# Theming

Bulma provides [an exhaustive list of variables](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/variables/) 
useful in theming and customizing its components. Bulma Native does too!

## Defining a custom theme

Bulma Native ships with the same default theme as Bulma. However, if you would like to customize any of 
the theme variables, you will need to wrap your app in an `ApplicationProvider`

Simply import `theme` and override any of the theme variables with your customizations.

```
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ApplicationProvider, Text, theme } from 'bulma-native';

const myCustomTheme = {
  ...theme,
  primary: 'purple',
}

const Home = () => (
  <Layout style={{flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}>
    <Text color="primary">Home screen</Text>
  </Layout>
);

export default () => (
  <ApplicationProvider theme={myCustomTheme}>
    <Home />
  </ApplicationProvider>
);
```

The full list of variables available for customization is 
[available here](https://github.com/jessicarobins/bulma-native/blob/master/src/theme/variables.ts).

### A note on variables
Some variables end in `-Multiplier`. This is because React Native doesn't have a built in concept of 
`rem` or `em`. Any variable that ends in `-Multiplier` will be multiplied by the font size of the 
component.

For example, a `<Button size="large />` will have a horizontal padding equal to 
`theme.buttonPaddingHorizontalMultipler * theme.sizeLarge`
