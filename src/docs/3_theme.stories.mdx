# Theming

Bulma provides [an exhaustive list of variables](https://bulma.io/documentation/customize/variables/) 
useful in theming and customizing its components. Bulma Native does too!

## Using the theme in your components

All Bulma Native components are already hooked into the application theme. If you would like to 
use the same theme variables in your own custom components, Bulma Native exports a `useTheme` hook.
Simply add the hook to your component and have access to all of the theme variables.

```js
import React from 'react';
import { useTheme, Text } from 'bulma-native';

export const MyCoolComponent = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return (
    <Text style={{backgroundColor: theme.colors.primary}}>
      It's text with a primary-colored background!
    </Text>
  )
}
```

## Defining a custom theme

Bulma Native ships with the same default theme as Bulma. However, if you would like to customize any of 
the theme variables, you will need to wrap your app in an `ApplicationProvider`

Simply import `theme` and override any of the theme variables with your customizations.

<Story id="customization-theming--basic" />

```js
// App.js
import React from 'react';
import { ApplicationProvider, Button, Text, theme } from 'bulma-native';

const myCustomTheme = {
  ...theme,
  color: {
    ...theme.colors,
    primary: 'purple',
  }
}

const Home = () => (
  <Button
    color="primary"
    variant="solid"
  >
    <Text>Custom Button</Text>
  </Button>
);

export default () => (
  <ApplicationProvider theme={myCustomTheme}>
    <Home />
  </ApplicationProvider>
);
```

The full list of variables available for customization is 
[available here](https://github.com/jessicarobins/bulma-native/blob/master/src/theme/variables.ts).

### A note on variables
Some variables end in `-Multiplier`. This is because React Native doesn't have a built in concept of 
`rem` or `em`. Any variable that ends in `-Multiplier` will be multiplied by the font size of the 
component.

For example, a `<Button size="large />` will have a horizontal padding equal to 
`theme.buttonPaddingHorizontalMultipler * theme.sizeLarge`
