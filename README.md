# Bulma Native

Bulma Native is a React Native port of the amazing CSS component library, [Bulma](https://bulma.io/).

## Getting started

This guide will help you start using Bulma Native components in your React Native app.

If you have not already set up a React Native project, please refer to
the [React Native documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to
get started. Bulma Native will work with both Expo and vanilla React Native projects.

### Install

```bash
yarn add bulma-native
```

#### Installing Icons

If you would like to use components that include icons, and you are not using Expo, you will also need
to add [React Native Vector Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) and follow its
installation instructions.

If you are using Expo, Icons are already built in via the [@expo/vector-icons](https://docs.expo.io/guides/icons/)
library.

## Previewing components

### Component preview notes

The components in this Storybook were adapted to web using [React Native Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).
As such, components are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate reflection of what they would look like on a device.
